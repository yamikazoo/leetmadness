The files inddex.html, audioDistorter.js use the base file audio.mp3, so when we implement the audio feature gonna somehow need to update so when user skips track it switches with it as well. Not too sure how to do it but will try.

index.html and audioDistorter.js are like "frameworks ig?" its like  a base page that just need to change few things for it to work.
